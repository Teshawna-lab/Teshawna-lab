- Hi, my name is Teshawna. 
- I'm an MPH candidate studying Epidemiology and Biostatistics.
- I’m currently learning how data analysis can be used to answer pertinent questions in public health. I will use GitHub to track my progress in my data science coursework, 
and projects I may take on.
- Outside of school, I enjoy reading African literature, discovering recipes online and frantically trying them out, and watching "trashy" reality shows.
